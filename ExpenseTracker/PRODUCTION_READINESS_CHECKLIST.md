- [ ] File contains all three required variables
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** `.env` is in `.gitignore` (verify with `git status`)

---

## Step 2: Review Testing Roadmap üìä

### 2.1 Read TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md

```powershell
# Open the coverage report
code TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md

# Or use your preferred editor
notepad TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md
```

**Key Sections to Review:**

1. **Current Coverage Status** (Page 1)
   - Overall: 19.93% (target: 80%)
   - Utilities: 96.96% ‚úÖ
   - Core business logic: 0% ‚ö†Ô∏è

2. **Roadmap to 80% Coverage** (Page 2-4)
   - Phase 1: Core Business Logic (+20%)
   - Phase 2: Integration Tests (+15%)
   - Phase 3: Component Tests (+25%)
   - Estimated effort: 10-15 days

3. **Testing Checklist** (Page 5)
   - Prioritized modules
   - Critical vs. nice-to-have

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Understand current coverage status
- [ ] Note that utility functions are 100% tested
- [ ] Acknowledge that AppContext, repositories, and screens need tests
- [ ] (Optional) Plan testing sprints if needed before production

**Decision Point:**

> **Question:** Do you want to increase test coverage to 80% before production release?
>
> - **Option A (Recommended):** Yes - Follow Phase 1-3 roadmap (10-15 days)
> - **Option B (Quick Release):** No - Deploy with current coverage, add tests iteratively

**My Recommendation:** For personal use, Option B is acceptable. For distribution, go with Option A.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Read TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md
- [ ] Understand coverage gaps
- [ ] Decide on testing strategy (Option A or B)

## Step 3: Generate Release Keystore üîë

### 3.1 Create Release Keystore

```powershell
# Navigate to android/app directory
cd C:\Users\faith\Documents\Codes\Personal-Expense-Tracker\ExpenseTracker\android\app

# Generate keystore (replace YOUR_NAME with your actual name)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore expense-tracker-release.keystore -alias expense-tracker -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# You'll be prompted for:
# 1. Keystore password (choose a STRONG password, save it!)
# 2. Key password (can be same as keystore password)
# 3. First and last name
# 4. Organizational unit (can be "Personal")
# 5. Organization (can be your name)
# 6. City or Locality
# 7. State or Province
# 8. Two-letter country code (e.g., US, GB, etc.)

# Example interaction:
# Enter keystore password: MyStr0ngP@ssw0rd123!
# Re-enter new password: MyStr0ngP@ssw0rd123!
# What is your first and last name? [Unknown]: Faith Developer
# What is the name of your organizational unit? [Unknown]: Personal
# What is the name of your organization? [Unknown]: Faith
# What is the name of your City or Locality? [Unknown]: London
# What is the name of your State or Province? [Unknown]: England
# What is the two-letter country code for this unit? [Unknown]: GB
# Is CN=Faith Developer, OU=Personal, O=Faith, L=London, ST=England, C=GB correct? [no]: yes
```

**Verify Keystore Created:**

```powershell
# Check file exists
ls expense-tracker-release.keystore

# Should show file with size ~2-3 KB
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY STEP:**

**Save your keystore details SECURELY:**

1. Create a password manager entry (e.g., LastPass, 1Password, KeePass)
2. Store:
   - Keystore password
   - Key alias: `expense-tracker`
   - Key password (if different from keystore password)
   - Path: `android/app/expense-tracker-release.keystore`

3. **Backup the keystore file:**
   ```powershell
   # Copy to secure location (external drive, encrypted cloud storage)
   Copy-Item expense-tracker-release.keystore D:\Backups\ExpenseTracker\
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** If you lose this keystore, you **cannot** update your app. You'll need to publish a new app with a different package name.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Keystore generated successfully
- [ ] Keystore password saved in password manager
- [ ] Keystore file backed up to secure location
- [ ] `.gitignore` excludes `*.keystore` (verify: keystore should NOT appear in `git status`)

---

### 3.2 Get SHA-1 Fingerprint

```powershell
# Still in android/app directory
keytool -list -v -keystore expense-tracker-release.keystore -alias expense-tracker

# Enter keystore password when prompted
```

**Expected Output:**

```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Error:** `SDK location not found`

**Fix:**
```powershell
$env:ANDROID_HOME = "C:\Users\faith\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk"
# Restart PowerShell
```

---

**Error:** `Execution failed for task ':app:validateSigningRelease'`

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Verify release signing env vars
echo $env:RELEASE_STORE_FILE
echo $env:RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
echo $env:RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
echo $env:RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD

# If any are empty, re-set them
```

---

**Error:** `Keystore file ... not found`

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Check keystore path
ls android\app\expense-tracker-release.keystore

# If missing, regenerate (Step 3.1) or restore from backup
```

---

### Google OAuth Fails

**Error:** `DEVELOPER_ERROR` or `12501` error code

**Fixes:**
1. Verify Client ID in `.env` matches Google Cloud Console
2. Verify SHA-1 fingerprint is correct (re-check Step 3.2)
3. Verify package name is `com.expensetracker` in both:
   - `android/app/build.gradle`
   - Google Cloud Console OAuth client
4. Try creating a new OAuth client with same settings
5. Rebuild app after changing `.env`: `pnpm build:android:release`

---

**Error:** `redirect_uri_mismatch`

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Verify redirect URI in .env
Get-Content .env | Select-String "REDIRECT_URI"

# Should be: com.expensetracker:/oauth2redirect/google
```

---

### App Crashes on Launch

**Steps:**
1. Capture logs:
   ```powershell
   adb logcat -s ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V > crash-logs.txt
   ```
2. Look for `FATAL EXCEPTION` or `Error:` messages
3. Common causes:
   - Missing `.env` file
   - Invalid Google Client ID
   - SQLite database corruption (clear app data)

**Quick fix:**
```powershell
# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.expensetracker

# Reinstall APK
adb install -r android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```
